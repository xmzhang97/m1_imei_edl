DISCLAIMER I DID NOT MAKE ANY OF THESE FILES OR PROGRAMS.
 
Plug your M1 into your computer with a USB cable
 
go to https://github.com/bkerler/edl download the file to your desktop and extract it
 
download microsft C++ build tools to your desktop https://visualstudio.microsoft.com/visual-cpp-build-tools/
You may need to run the installer once but not install anything to make the other steps work
 
install python from python.org/downloads/ and at the fist setup prompt chose add python to PATH then continue the installation
 
download putty from https://www.putty.org/
 
 
 
Open Command prompt and type (hit enter after every line)
 
cd Desktop
 
vs_buildtools.exe --norestart --passive --downloadThenInstall --includeRecommended --add Microsoft.VisualStudio.Workload.NativeDesktop --add Microsoft.VisualStudio.Workload.VCTools --add Microsoft.VisualStudio.Workload.MSBuildTools
 
then let that finish downloading and installing.
 
go back to your Command prompt window and type
 
cd edl-master
 
pip3 install -r requirements.txt
 
cd edlclient
 
cd tools
 
 
open putty and type 192.168.1.1 (or if you changed the ip of the M1 use that) in the Host name and 5510 in the port.
Select telnet then press Open
once the window opens type AT!OPENLOCK? and hit enter
The response you get out of that should look something like BE96CBBEE0829BCA
 
copy that output and go back to your Command prompt window and type py sierrakeygen.py -l BE96CBBEE0829BCA -d MDM9x40 (replace BE96CBBEE0829BCA with the output from the Putty window)
 
then go back to the Putty window and type AT!OPENLOCK=[BE96CBBEE0829BCA] (again replace BE96CBBEE0829BCA with your number)
 
type AT!NVIMEIUNLOCK
 
then type AT!NVENCRYPTIMEI=12,34,56,78,90,12,34,52 (replace the numbers with the numbers from your IMEI)
 
then type AT!RESET
 
The M1 should reboot and your IMEI should be changed.
